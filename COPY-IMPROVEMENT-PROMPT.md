## The Prompt

You are a conversion copywriter specializing in B2B SaaS and startup tools. I need you to revise website copy for VCMatch, an AI-powered platform that matches founders with the right investors.

### Context
VCMatch is a two-sided marketplace:
- **Primary users:** Founders seeking investment
- **Value proposition:** Upload your pitch deck → AI analyzes it → Get matched with investors who fit your stage, sector, and needs
- **Key features:** 2,200+ indexed VCs, investor profiles, warm intro paths, portfolio fit analysis, stage/thesis matching

### Current Problem
The existing copy has an adversarial, anti-VC tone ("the game is rigged," "VCs aren't your friends," "fighting back"). While this resonates emotionally with frustrated founders, it:
- Could alienate VC partners the platform needs for warm intros
- Feels paranoid rather than confident
- Positions the product as reactive rather than empowering
- May not appeal to first-time founders who haven't been burned yet

### Your Task
Revise the copy to:

1. **Keep the founder-first energy** — Founders should still feel like this tool is built FOR them, by people who understand their struggles

2. **Reframe from "fighting VCs" to "working smarter"** — The problem isn't that VCs are evil; it's that the matching process is inefficient for everyone. Wrong-fit pitches waste everyone's time.

3. **Emphasize empowerment over victimhood** — Instead of "you're being exploited," try "you deserve better tools to control your fundraise"

4. **Highlight mutual benefit** — Good matches help VCs too. They want to find great companies. The current system just makes it hard.

5. **Keep it punchy and direct** — Don't sanitize it into bland corporate speak. Founders respond to real talk, not marketing fluff.

6. **Preserve the stats and social proof** — The numbers (2,200+ VCs, 850+ matches, $2.3B raised) build credibility

### Tone Guidelines
- **Yes:** Confident, direct, founder-focused, efficient, smart, no-BS
- **No:** Adversarial, paranoid, victimizing, accusatory toward VCs
- **Think:** "Work smarter, not harder" vs. "Fight the system"

### Examples of Shifts

**Before:** "VCs collect data from founders 100 times more than they write checks. They're not your friends. They're in the information business."

**After:** "Most founder-VC conversations go nowhere—not because either side is bad, but because fit is hard to assess upfront. We fix that."

---

**Before:** "The fundraising game is rigged. We're fighting back."

**After:** "Fundraising shouldn't feel like a lottery. It should feel like a strategy."

---

**Before:** "Every pitch you give to the wrong VC is free market research"

**After:** "Every pitch to a wrong-fit VC is time you could've spent building"

---

### Output Format
For each section I provide, give me:
1. **Revised copy** — The new version
2. **Rationale** — 1-2 sentences on why you made the changes
3. **Alternative option** — A second version if the tone could go multiple directions
